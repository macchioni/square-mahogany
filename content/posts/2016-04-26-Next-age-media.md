The Joshua Topolsky's grocery list of what will matter in the next age of media.

- Compelling voices and stories, real and raw talent, new ideas that actually serve or delight an audience, brands that have meaning and ballast; these are things that matter in the next age of media. 
- Thinking of your platform as an actual platform, not a delivery method. 
- Knowing youâ€™re more than just your words. 
- Thinking of your business as a product and storytelling business, not a headline and body-copy business. 
- Thinking of your audience as finite and building a sustainable business model around that audienceâ€Šâ€”â€Šthatâ€™s going to matter. 
- Thinking about your 10 year plan and not a billion dollar valuationâ€Šâ€”â€Šthatâ€™s going to matter.
