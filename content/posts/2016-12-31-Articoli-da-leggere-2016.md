Purtroppo anche quest'anno non sono riuscito a usare un solo sistema per salvare articoli e post in maniera organica. Ma come nel 2015 ho continuato a usare una ricetta di [IF](https://ifttt.com/discover) che permette di formattare in modo abbastanza decente tutto quello che salvo su [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/). Non è tutto-tutto quello che salvo allo scopo di una lettura successiva (vero Feedly? vero Pinboard?), ma lo sparpagliamento inorganico è parte della mia identità digitale, credo. 

È stato l'anno di un sacco di gente, ma io qui trovo molto Donald Trump, intelligenze artificiali, Francesco Totti, Slack, Ed Snowden, Bullet Journaling, molto Il Post e il fantastico dibattito liberal sulla post-verità, che poi sono le "minchiate".
