This year started with a small project I really like: [Feeds for Journalists](https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists), by [Dave Winer](https://scripting.com/). The idea is that RSS is still a valid technology to get an effective and unbiased flow of news. 

As he puts it, after reading [a tweet by Mathew Ingram](https://twitter.com/mathewi/status/952214692918734848):

> If you're a journalist and you love RSS, please join me in an easy project to improve both. Let's put together a list of starter feeds for journalists.

Basically, we’re sharing our RSS bookmarks considering  only the accountable sources. Since [Facebook is pivoting from its initial position regarding news and its News Feed](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions), I think even the timing of [Feeds for Journalists](https://github.com/scripting/feedsForJournalists) is right. 

When good ol’ [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader) was killed by Google, I continued using RSS via Feedly, Inoreader and [Electric River](https://rss2.io/electric/) (the latter also by Dave). RSS is still the best option for massive news browsers, an indispensabile technology in any newsroom. Give it a try.

_Update:_ Dave made a [useful river here](https://scripting.com/journalists/).

_Bonus: since we spoke about Zuck, Frederic Filloux says [Facebook has all the reasons in the world to get rid of journalism](https://mondaynote.com/facebook-is-done-with-quality-journalism-deal-with-it-afc2475f1f84)._
