If you’ve been watching one of the first five episodes of [Ted Lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso), maybe you’ve been wondering what kind of biscuits he’s baking for his boss (portrayed by the gorgeous Hannah Waddingham). Because she really seems to like them.

Ted Lasso is a funny Apple TV+ show starring Jason Sudeikis as a mustached American football coach, recruited to manage an English Premier League team. He has zero experience with the European football, but he’s great at coaching thanks to his positive candor and his sense of community.

Waddingham - as Rebecca Welton, the owner of  AFC Richmond - is obsessed with the cookies Lasso brings her any morning as an excuse to talk with her. And she tries to discover where he gets those delicacies. Anyway, I tried to get a recipe to get something like the cookies we see in a couple of frames of the show.

Can’t assure those are 100% the Lasso’s, but you can bake that in your own sheet pan and see. Follow the coach.

### The Recipe
Basically we’re gonna make a Buttery Sheet Pan Shortbread that you have to cook super slowly for more than an hour. Then cut while hot, like Italian biscotti/cantucci, then sprinkle with sugar and finally let cool.


##### Ingredients

* 250 gr white granulated sugar
* 565 gr salted butter
* 200 gr (organic) rice flour
* 480 gr all-purpose flour (Type 00)
* 2 tbs coarse brown sugar
<br />
* Rectangular Sheet Pan (about 17x12 in.)
* Parchment paper
* Your favorite bowl
* Patience

-----

![Bake it](/images/vault/baking.jpg)


##### Bake with Lasso!
Preheat your oven to 140° C (about 270 ° F; yes, that low).
<br>

1. If you have a stand mixer beat butter and sugar until fluffy. If you have not, forget the Vitamix or any immersion-blender: get a wooden spoon and prepare to have your right arm like the one The Rock shows to people.
<br>

2. Mix in the rice flour, beat gently and gradually add the flour. Oh, God: have you used plain butter instead of salted butter? No prob, now you sprinkle 5 grams of salt in the magic bowl.
<br>

3. Use your hands am quickly make a whithe-y dough, lightly sandy. Resist and do not eat it raw.
<br>

4. Parchment paper on your baking sheet, dough inside (height about 1-1,5 cm) and get ready for the first bake: 60 minutes, not right below the grill, give your baby some space.
<br>

5. Second bake: bring the heat to 120° C (about 250° F), cover your mega biscuit with a layer of parchment paper and let it go for another 20 minutes.
<br>

6. Out of the oven: the cookie surface is cooked but not burned, sprinkle it with brown sugar and let cool for about 2 minutes (now you’re hoping the sugar somehow sticks to the surface). Then get the thinnest sharpest knife you have and cut the biscuits in harmonic rectangular shapes of your choice.
<br>

Let them cool for a longer time, get back and enjoy. You scored them right if you have not rawish dough in the middle.
<br>

_Remember: any two bites, one is pure saturated fat. Apparently, that’s the Lasso way (yes, shortbreads are Scottish)_ ⚽︎
