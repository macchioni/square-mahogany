The latest campaign of the World Wide Web Foundation is about open web and it's called [#ForTheWeb](https://fortheweb.webfoundation.org/). They have a [manifesto](https://fortheweb.webfoundation.org/principles) and a [fancy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kNlG3DWkC4) too.

>The free and open web is facing real challenges. More than half of the world’s population still are not online. For the other half, the web’s undeniable benefits seem to come with far too many unacceptable risks: to our privacy, our democracy, even our mental health. **#ForTheWeb** is a global campaign of people like you, uniting as one voice to get governments, companies and the public to stand up for a free, open and safe web that benefits everyone.

They say there are 3 ways to join the campaign:

**1. Share your web story.** How has the web changed your life? What do you use it for? What are your hopes for its future? We want to know. Film your story and post it on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or anywhere else at #ForTheWeb.

**2. Help building a contract for the web.** With partners around the world, we’re building a Contract #ForTheWeb to ensure a free, open and fair web for everyone.

**3. Join the fight for the web.** Basically sign up to their newsletter and keep in touch.
