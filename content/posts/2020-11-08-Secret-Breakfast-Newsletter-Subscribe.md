### The Recipe
Basically we’re gonna make a Buttery Sheet Pan Shortbread that you have to cook super slowly for more than an hour. Then cut while hot, like Italian biscotti/cantucci, then sprinkle with sugar and finally let cool.


##### Ingredients

* 250 gr white granulated sugar
* 565 gr salted butter
* 200 gr (organic) rice flour
* 480 gr all-purpose flour (Type 00)
* 2 tbs coarse brown sugar
<br />
* Rectangular Sheet Pan (about 17x12 in.)
* Parchment paper
* Your favorite bowl
* Patience

##### Bake with Lasso!
Preheat your oven to 140° C (about 270 ° F; yes, that low).
<br>

1. If you have a stand mixer beat butter and sugar until fluffy. If you have not, forget the Vitamix or any immersion-blender: get a wooden spoon and prepare to have your right arm like the one The Rock shows to people.
<br>

2. Mix in the rice flour, beat gently and gradually add the flour. Oh, God: have you used plain butter instead of salted butter? No prob, now you sprinkle 5 grams of salt in the magic bowl.
<br>

3. Use your hands am quickly make a whithe-y dough, lightly sandy. Resist and do not eat it raw.
<br>

4. Parchment paper on your baking sheet, dough inside (height about 1-1,5 cm) and get ready for the first bake: 60 minutes, not right below the grill, give your baby some space.
<br>

5. Second bake: bring the heat to 120° C (about 250° F), cover your mega biscuit with a layer of parchment paper and let it go for another 20 minutes.
<br>

6. Out of the oven: the cookie surface is cooked but not burned, sprinkle it with brown sugar and let cool for about 2 minutes (now you’re hoping the sugar somehow sticks to the surface). Then get the thinnest sharpest knife you have and cut the biscuits in harmonic rectangular shapes of your choice.
<br>

Let them cool for a longer time, get back and enjoy. You scored them right if you have not rawish dough in the middle.

_Remember: any two bites, one is pure saturated fat. Apparently, that’s the Lasso way (yes, shortbreads are Scottish)_ ⚽︎
