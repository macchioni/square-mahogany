_This is a develomping post_


Food newsletter are having a moment and here are the best  fo yer 2021 

Hi there, I wanted to know what you think about indie food newsletters. I've recently discovered a few out there and maybe you have more to suggest.
These are the ones I find more interesting, useful or entertaining. All of them are free or have a free version.

A Newsletter by Alison Roman - I really find her fun, with a writing style of her own. Sometimes messy, sometimes joyful, always entertaining.
Family Meal. This is about good news for the restaurant industry. Much needed, now. Good writing, easy to love even if sometimes is so industry-related (which is good, in some ways).

Secret Breakfast. A newsletter about the ways food makes our life better "in new and dangerous ways". Any week you get also interesting links. It tastes sincere and quite crazy, like old blogging.

Vittles. This one is almost a magazine with longform reading by interesting authors and custom made illustration. Worthy, but not for anybody.

Stained Page News. A newsletter about food books that does what it says.
